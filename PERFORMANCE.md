# Backend Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the backend of the Pisval Tech POS system.

## Response Caching

We've implemented two levels of response caching:

1. **Built-in ASP.NET Core Response Caching**: Provides standard HTTP caching based on cache headers.
2. **Custom Response Caching Middleware**: Provides more fine-grained control over what gets cached and for how long.

### How it works

- Only GET requests are cached
- Authenticated requests are not cached by default
- Responses are cached for 5 minutes by default
- Only successful (200 OK) JSON responses are cached

## Database Optimizations

### Connection Resiliency

- Automatic retry on connection failures (up to 5 times)
- Configurable command timeout (30 seconds)
- Query tracking disabled for read-only operations to improve performance

### Database Indexes

We've added indexes to frequently queried columns to improve query performance:

- Primary tables (Products, Customers, Sales, Inventory, Orders)
- Composite indexes for frequently joined tables
- Full-text search indexes
- Timestamp column indexes for filtering

## Response Compression

Response compression is enabled for all API responses to reduce bandwidth usage and improve load times:

- Enabled for HTTPS connections
- Configured for various MIME types (JSON, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)

## Cache Control Headers

Static assets are configured with appropriate cache control headers:

- JavaScript and CSS files are cached for 1 year (31536000 seconds)
- Static files in the /static directory are cached for 1 year

## How to Run Database Optimizations

To apply the database optimizations, run the following command from the backend directory:

```bash
cd Scripts
./optimize-database.sh
```

This script will:
1. Create all the necessary indexes
2. Run VACUUM ANALYZE to update statistics

## Monitoring Performance

To monitor the performance of your API:

1. Check the logs for slow query warnings
2. Use the Swagger UI to test API response times
3. Monitor database performance using PostgreSQL's built-in tools

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing these additional optimizations:

1. Add Redis for distributed caching in multi-server environments
2. Implement API rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. Add database query optimization monitoring
4. Use asynchronous processing for long-running tasks
